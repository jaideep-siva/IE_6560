# Dynamic Programming Model for Trip Planning in Michigan

## Project Overview
This project involves a dynamic programming model for trip planning in Michigan. The model aims to optimize satisfaction and budget for trips, with a real-time interactive interface built using Streamlit. The project includes data preparation, model implementation, and visualization of results.

## Files Included
1. `data_generator.py` - Script for generating synthetic data for testing the model.
2. `environment.yml` - Conda environment file for setting up the project dependencies.
4. `interface.py` - Streamlit interface for interacting with the dynamic programming model.
5. `michigan_locations.csv` - Dataset containing information about various locations in Michigan.

## Setting Up the Environment
To set up the environment, use the provided `environment.yml` file to create a Conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate trip_planning_env
